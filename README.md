# Adopt Me!

## What is Adopt Me?

Adopt Me is a mini project thought up by me (and directed by LLCoolRay). Adopt Me will allow users to search for their future pet using information from PetFinder.

## Our Goals

The goal of Adopt Me is to help users search for their ideal pet  by display information from PetFinder and. This mini project should help me develop some front end and back end skills. This will also help sharpen the skills of LLCool
